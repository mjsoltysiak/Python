Coding game solution of probelm:

A finance company is carrying out a study on the worst stock 
investments and would like to acquire a program to do so. 
The program must be able to analyze a chronological series of stock 
values in order to show the largest loss that it is possible to 
make by buying a share at a given time t0 and by selling it at a later date t1.
The loss will be expressed as the difference in value between t0 and t1.
If there is no loss, the loss will be worth 0.
